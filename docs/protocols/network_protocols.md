# Network Communication Protocols

Network communication protocols are essential for the operation of quantum networks, enabling the transmission of quantum information between nodes. This document outlines the key protocols used in quantum networking.

## Key Protocols

### 1. Quantum Teleportation

Quantum teleportation is a method for transferring quantum states between distant parties using entanglement and classical communication.

#### Steps:
1. **Entanglement Sharing**: Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits.
2. **Measurement**: Alice performs a joint measurement on her qubit and the qubit she wants to teleport.
3. **Classical Communication**: Alice sends the measurement results to Bob.
4. **State Reconstruction**: Bob applies a unitary operation based on Alice's results to his half of the entangled pair, reconstructing the original state.

### 2. Quantum Repeaters

Quantum repeaters are devices that extend the range of quantum communication by enabling entanglement swapping and error correction.

#### Functionality:
- **Entanglement Distribution**: Repeaters create and maintain entangled states over long distances.
- **Error Correction**: They implement error correction schemes to ensure the fidelity of the transmitted quantum states.

## Security Considerations

Network protocols must ensure the security of transmitted quantum information. This includes:
- **Eavesdropping Detection**: Protocols should be designed to detect any unauthorized access to the quantum channel.
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication methods must be employed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Implementation

The Quantum Internet Core includes implementations of quantum teleportation and quantum repeater protocols. For usage examples, refer to the [usage documentation](usage.md).
